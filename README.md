# Pokemon Replay Analyzer
This is my program to analyze a Pokémon showdown replay, however, it is still a work in progress so it does not work properly as of right now.


# Current features:
  - Finds the names of both players.
  - Fills list of all Pokémon on both sides.
  - Gets nicknames (if applicable) for all Pokémon that have hit the field.
  - Applies fainting stats for all Pokémon
  - Applies kills to the right Pokémon for:
    - Sandstorm
    - Hail
    - Poison (and toxic poison, also works with toxic spikes)


# Planned features:
  - Applying kills by:
    - Direct damage
    - Burn
    - Hazards (stealth rock and spikes)
  - Creating a GUI
